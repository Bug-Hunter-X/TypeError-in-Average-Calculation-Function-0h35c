This repository demonstrates a common Python error: a TypeError that occurs when attempting arithmetic operations on a list containing incompatible data types. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and input validation. This example highlights the importance of type checking and handling unexpected input in Python functions.
